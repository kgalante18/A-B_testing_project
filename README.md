This project is part of Udacity's Data Analyst course in Practical Statistics. The project objective is to evaluate the performance of an A/B test for two different versions of a webpage for an e-commerce website. 

Part 1 includes several 
exploratory checks and calculations to display the probability of an individual converting regardless of the page they receive; probability of conversion for an individual that was in the control group or in the treatment group

Part II is the A/B test which compares two different versions of the webapge to determine which one performs better.


Part III uses regression as an alternative to produce the same results as the A/B test in Part II
